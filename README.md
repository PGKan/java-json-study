# java-json-study
The studying of using JSON in Java with Eclipse IDE.

There is a `doc` directory under this repository. There are 3 files under the
`doc` directory, they are `JSON.html`, `JSON.md` and `JSON.pdf`. They are the
same document with the different file formats. The html file needs the folder
`json-md` to work properly. The md file is good for viewing directly on GitHub.
And the JSON.pdf is a stand-alone document which don't require the folder
`json-md` to work properly.

There is a `lib` directory under this repository. There are 3 Jar files under
this directory, the `gson-2.8.6.jar` is mandatory for the sample codes to work
properly. The javadoc nad sources files are optional to setup.

There is a `res` directory under this repository. It contains the JSON files
needed in the sample codes.

There are 2 source folders in the repository, they are `src` and `test`. The `src`
folder is the sample code itself, the `test` folder can use as verification of
library installation.

## Installation
If you download the whole repository as an Eclipse project, the `.classpath` and 
the `.project` files should contain the installed information. Do test the
installation before using.

If you want to create the environment yourself, follow the document `doc/JSON.*`
to do the installation processes.
